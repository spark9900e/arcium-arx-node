# Strategic Decisions (from Claude advisory sessions)

## Feb 16, 2026

### Mainnet Status
- Mainnet-alpha is LIVE but permissioned
- Devnet is just a developer sandbox — no incentive to run nodes
- Open node operator selection hasn't been announced yet
- Stop chasing devnet SOL — focus shifted

### Priority Change
- Build on Arcium SDK to get noticed by the team
- Engage in developer-discussion with substance
- Hardware and node config are READY for when selection opens

### Hardware Strategy
- 10x EPYC 7742 + Supermicro boards available
- Need to confirm: does Arcium TEE require Intel SGX or support AMD SEV?
- One EPYC can run the node, rest can mine Monero
- Start with one machine at WolfPaw, scale when mainnet opens

### Identity
- Migrating GitHub to pseudonymous account
- Scrubbed git config
- Keep real name off all public-facing Arcium infrastructure

### Business Model
- Own cluster long-term, not just a single node
- Free colo at WolfPaw = margin advantage over cloud operators
- Company absorbs power costs
